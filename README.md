The Australian Road Deaths Database provides basic details of road transport crash fatalities in Australia as reported by the police each month to the State and Territory road safety authorities.

# Aim of this Project
To provide an in depth data analysis of the number of crashes and correlations with location, speed and time of the day. A side goal is to gain more experience with the use of python's pandas and matplotlib libraries. 

# Basic Visualisation of the Data

An overall trend that the number of fatal crashes has decreased overtime for every state / territory in Australia

Suggests that New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland share the majority of all fatal crashes in Australia since 1989. This can be assumed that a larger population will result in more fatal crashes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_list_of_states_and_territories_of_Australia)

Fatalities occur most during the hours of afternoon peak time. Data suggests that many fatalities are caused when primary / secondary school finishes (time period between 3pm - 4pm) and parents come to pick their children up.

Graph suggests that the most amount of fatal crashes occur at the speeds of 100km/hr (freeways and highways) and at 60km/hr (roads and streets). https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/safety-and-road-rules/driver-safety/speeding/school-speed-zones suggests that the original speed of 80km/hr (now 60km/hr normal, 40km/hr during school hours) shows us that the school hour pick-up time is when most of the fatal crashes occur.

Majority of fatal crashes occur with cars (86.1%) and with construction vehicles (articulated trucks) at 9.5%
