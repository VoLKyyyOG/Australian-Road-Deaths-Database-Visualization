The Australian Road Deaths Database provides basic details of road transport crash fatalities in Australia as reported by the police each month to the State and Territory road safety authorities.

# Aim of this Project
To provide an in depth data analysis of the number of crashes and correlations with location, velocity and time.

Current findings suggest that:
- The number of fatal crashes have decreased over time (1989 - 2017)
- New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland share the largest number of fatal crashes
- On average, more than 1 person(s) die as a result of a fatal crash (Odds are at 47.3:52.7)
- December sees the most number of accidents (9%) whilst February see the least (7.5%)
- Cars make up the majority (86.1%) of vehicles involved in car accidents, followed by Articulated Trucks at 9.5%
- Fatal crashes are more likely to occur at 100km/hr or 60km/hr
- The year 2014 showed the least amount of car crashes whilst 1989 showed the most amount.
- The highest average number of crashes occur during 3pm-6pm which suggest that peak hour traffic and school zone pickups play a major role in causing accidents.
